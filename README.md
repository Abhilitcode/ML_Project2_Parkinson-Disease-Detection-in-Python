# Parkinson's-Disease-Detection-in-Python
This project is an implementation of a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has Parkinson's disease based on various voice measures.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Parkinsons Data Set, which was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The dataset contains 195 records of voice measurements, taken from 31 people, 23 of which were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

RESULTS:
The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 87.18% in predicting Parkinson's disease based on the voice measurements.
